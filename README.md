## FAQ

---

### What's a bird code? 

Bird codes/banding codes are four-letter nicknames for birds. I've made a tiny guide to get started [here](https://birdcodes.glitch.me).

BRDL uses [these codes](https://www.aba.org/aba-checklist/) for solutions, but uses several bird code sources to help faciliate guessing.

### When does BRDL update?

BRDL updates at midnight depending on your devices's local time.

### Is looking at bird codes/field guides cheating? 

It's a valid strategy! Not referencing guides while playing the game could be considered hard mode.

### What's a Glitch? 🎏

Glitch is the friendly place to build the app of your dreams! It's is where BRDL was created and is currently hosted. Glitch makes it easy and fun to build your own or remix other people's web pages.

Feel free to check out the files, but **be warned that spoilers may be found in previous.txt!**

### Can you make a ___ version? 🐦

BRDL is limited to North American birds, but BRDL can be remixed to your heart's content! For example, [this is a boilerplate UK version of BRDL](https://glitch.com/~futuristic-spiral-soil) using 5-letter BTO codes and the default solution of "QUAIL".

### Help I've found a bug! 🚩

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at hootalex or email at 1alextomlinson  gmail  com. I will do my best to squash bugs, but I am admittedly not a developer! This app is pretty glued together (see credits!). Though hopefully this puts me in a better position to walk anyone through remixing this game if they need help! :)
